# 2020F_Computer_Vision

Language : Python
Implementing functions in opencv by using numpy.

Project 1 : 1D, 2D Gaussian filters, visualizing edges, suppressed edges, corners and suppressed corners.

Project 2 : 2D transformation, 2D homography.

Project 3 : Fundamental Matrix by eight-point algorithm. Just eight-point algorithm, normalized version, RANSAC version. Visualizing epipolar lines
